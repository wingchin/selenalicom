synopsis:       Owing to the destitution during their youth, LI LIAN-YING (Wayne Lai) and AN DE-HAI (Raymond Cho) have presented themselves as eunuchs in the court, where they serve their apprenticeship with an old eunuch LAU DOR-SANG (Chung King-Fai). Having closely bonded to one another, the two respectively played dominant roles during the rule of Empress Dowager CIXI (Michelle Yim). However, unlike De-Hai's single-minded obsession with greed, Lian-Ying overcautiously abides by the rules, gradually diverging from the former. In view of them gaining recognition from Cixi, the Head Eunuch CHAN FOK (Elliot Yue) resorts to strike treachery against Lian-Ying and De-Hai, feeling that his position is threatened. Fortunately, with the help of his two close friends, a palace maid SIN-YUNG (Nancy Wu) and a eunuch of the Imperial Dispensary YIU SHEUNG-HEI (Raymond Wong), Lian-Ying manages to avert the disaster. With the Emperor TONGZHI (Oscar Leung) conferring the throne on his Empress, Empress Dowager CIAN (Maggie Shiu) fears that Cixi will further wield power. She then colludes with Prince GONG (Cheung Kwok-Keung) to sow discords among the court, isolating Cixi. In the face of such ever-changing phenomena, only Lian-Ying firmly stands his ground on the motto of "A servant is no more than a servant", remaining as Cixi’s loyal attendant.

    personality:    Consort Yuen fairly metes out gratitude and grudge, she treats her servants with courtesy, but has been harboring hard feelings for her enemy, Empress Dowager Cixi, all along.
    background:     Consort Yuen is a consort of Emperor Xianfeng. Unfortunately, Xianfeng had too many consorts and Consort Yuen was neglected. Feeling lonely in the palace, she frequently hung around in Bureau of Peace and Prosperity and was attracted by the young male opera performer Yuk Chun (Vin Choi). The two fell in love and got into an illicit affair. Later she discovered that she got pregnant. Upon learning of her pregnancy, Yuk Chun unexpectedly left her. Disheartened by this, Consort Yuen had no choice but to give birth to her son and declared he was Xianfeng’s. When the baby was born, Cixi finds out that the baby isn’t Xianfeng’s biological child. She ordered people to take away Consort Yuen’s son and had him killed. Consort Yuen was put in the cold palace thereafter.
    happenings:     Having a peaceful and dull life in the Palace of Great Benevolence, Consort Yuen treats her group of eunuchs and maids like family and lives together harmoniously. Among them, she has the most profound connection with Lee Lin-Yin. Over the years, Cixi would order an eunuch to reprimand Consort Yuen during the festive. However, Lin Yin and the others do not know at all what she has committed to deserve this. Consort Yuen never has any desires. However, when she hears that Cixi announced that all consorts of the emperor will be allowed to leave the palace, and herself being the only one to die of old age in the Forbidden Palace, she feels that life is dreary and hence decides to hang herself…
