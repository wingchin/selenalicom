  Chau, helping her mother <strong>Ip Wing-Shan</strong> (<em>Susan Tse</em>) run
  the holiday home rental business. It turns out that Hei-Man has secretly joined
  hands with some outsiders, planning to develop a hotel conglomerate. Hei Man also
  attempts to have an affair with Po-Sang, trying to make Po Po go away. What Hei
  Man has done is noticed by her first love <strong>Ching Lai-Wing</strong> (<em>Ruco
