        <p><strong>Au Yeung Wai-Lan</strong> (<em>Yuen Chau</em>), owner of a martial arts training school, is reunited with her long-lost son <strong>Koo Yu-Cheung</strong> (<em>Kevin Cheng</em>) after years of agonizing separation. On his return home, Cheung is shocked to find that his younger brother <strong>Koo Yu-Tong</strong> (<em>Kenneth Ma</em>) has been critically ill and that his father was murdered long ago by <strong>Wing Tak</strong> (<em>Dominic Lam</em>), the existing director of a pharmaceutical company and a bitter old foe of the Koo's. Cheung has never been into kung-fu but shows glimpses of his potential when he strikes back at the impudent, arrogant <strong>Wing Man-Kwan</strong> (<em>Jacky Heung</em>), also the son of Tak. Pinning all her hopes on Cheung, Lan not only teaches him a special set of kung-fu skills created by the family, but also registers for him for the Guangdong Boxing Championship Tournament. Out of the blue, Cheung's opponent in the final turns out to be Kwan.  starts losing his bearings after achieving growing success and recognition in the field of martial arts. Caught up in the love triangle between Lan's apprentice <strong>Ying Ngan Ming</strong> (<em>Natalie Tong</em>), his dream girl <strong>Chow Mui Mui</strong> (<em>Nancy Wu</em>) and himself, Cheung is utterly confused and exhausted, which later causes his failure in the final tournament.</p>

Towards things that cannot go through the eyes she'll fight the injustice, she will not yield and she often opposes her father Wing Tak (<em>Dominic Lam</em>). She's faithful towards love, for love she is willing to be penalized.</div>

Since then, whenever Tong came in troubles and has to compete with others in fighting, he’ll look for Ching to take the miracle drug to help him out of his predicament. Because of this, Ching’s understanding for Tong deepened. Ching discovered that although Tong’s attitude is quite arrogant, but he treasures his family the most. Even more, he is not afraid of larger powers, he suppresses the strong and aids the weak. Ching’s attraction to him grows.  Yeung Wai Lan (<em>Yuen Chau</em>) once has abdominal pain, Ching diagnosed it as chronic appendicitis, this required her to undergo a surgery, but Lan was afraid that after anesthesia she won’t wake up anymore and she refused the threatment. Lan’s condition became worse by the day. Ching didn’t feel annoyed when she personally tried to convince Lan many times, this made her leave a good impression on Lan.

Sadly, the grudge of the two families are deeply entangled. When Ching found out that Tak is the murderer of Tong's grandfather and other people, she couldn't believe it. When Tak learnt of Tong and Ching's contact, he was furious, this deepened his hatred for Tong's family even more.  constantly did things to harm Tong's family, Ching felt very guilty, she was trapped between the hatred of the two families, this caused her to suffer greatly. Although Ching loved Tong truly, but their relationship was full of barriers. Finally, Ching forsakes the darkness for light, but whether the two can end up happily together remains unpredictable.</div>
