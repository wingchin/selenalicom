Despite her young age, she’s already in charge of the family business on behalf of her father. Although she sometimes has a spoiled bratty temperament, but in fact she’s kind-hearted; she chooses what’s right and holds fast to it, she’s a sentimental and emotional person, and is very filial towards Sue Tong.</div>
              <div id="background" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Born in a wealthy family, she’s the daughter of the extremely rich boss Cheuk Sue-Tong (<em>Cheung Kwok Keung</em>) of the great pharmacy Bak Hei Tong. Due to the early death of her mother, Chi Ying is overly doted by Sue Tong, growing a big missy temperament. But in front of others, she’s very ladylike, well-educated and well-mannered, and is later on behalf of her father in charge of the family business.</div>
              <div id="happenings" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Because of the Kangxi Dictionary incident Bak Hei Tong gets sealed. Chi Ying learns about Sue Tong’s identity, it turns out she herself is not his biological daughter. Sue Tong points out that Dor Po (<em>Steven Ma</em>) is an imperial bodyguard and hopes that Chi Ying can collect confidential information within the palace from Dor Po. Chi Ying struggles, but finally promises. Dor Po is kept in the dark about this. Chi Ying then goes to Seung Moon Lau to help out, the restaurant opened by Dor Po’s parents, seizing the chance to collect palace information from Dor Bo. But the longer Chi Ying gets along with Dor Po, the more guilt she feels for making use of him.  knowing that the fifth imperial uncle, Changning (<em>Tsui Wing</em>), has been worrying about the missing Princess Duanmin, Kangxi (<em>Power Chan</em>) orders Dor Po to search for Duanmin. Chi Ying impersonates Duanmin and follows him to the palace. Kangxi, Fuquan (<em>Kenneth Ma</em>), Changning are all treating her with warmth and affection, only Xiaozhuang (<em>Ching Hor Wai</em>) still distrusts her, causing Chi Ying to advance gradually and consolidate at every step.

              <div id="personality" class="tab-pane active" role="tabpanel">Very ladylike and has a generous style of talking. Despite her young age, she’s already in charge of the family business on behalf of her father. Although she sometimes has a spoiled bratty temperament, but in fact she’s kind-hearted; she chooses what’s right and holds fast to it, she’s a sentimental and emotional person, and is very filial towards Sue Tong.</div>
              <div id="background" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Born in a wealthy family, she’s the daughter of the extremely rich boss Cheuk Sue-Tong (<em>Cheung Kwok Keung</em>) of the great pharmacy Bak Hei Tong. Due to the early death of her mother, Chi Ying is overly doted by Sue Tong, growing a big missy temperament. But in front of others, she’s very ladylike, well-educated and well-mannered, and is later on behalf of her father in charge of the family business.</div>
              <div id="happenings" class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel">Because of the Kangxi Dictionary incident Bak Hei Tong gets sealed. Chi Ying learns about Sue Tong’s identity, it turns out she herself is not his biological daughter. Sue Tong points out that Dor Po (<em>Steven Ma</em>) is an imperial bodyguard and hopes that Chi Ying can collect confidential information within the palace from Dor Po. Chi Ying struggles, but finally promises. Dor Po is kept in the dark about this. Chi Ying then goes to Seung Moon Lau to help out, the restaurant opened by Dor Po’s parents, seizing the chance to collect palace information from Dor Bo. But the longer Chi Ying gets along with Dor Po, the more guilt she feels for making use of him.  knowing that the fifth imperial uncle, Changning (<em>Tsui Wing</em>), has been worrying about the missing Princess Duanmin, Kangxi (<em>Power Chan</em>) orders Dor Po to search for Duanmin. Chi Ying impersonates Duanmin and follows him to the palace. Kangxi, Fuquan (<em>Kenneth Ma</em>), Changning are all treating her with warmth and affection, only Xiaozhuang (<em>Ching Hor Wai</em>) still distrusts her, causing Chi Ying to advance gradually and consolidate at every step.
